Establishing faithfulness of binary decompilers is pivotal in gaining trust
in the results of downstream analyses performed on the decompiled programs. Validating the translation of \ISA programs to the lifted IR is often non-scalable because of the heavy weight formal equivalence checker employed for the task.   
We present a novel, scalable and formal technique and tooling infrastructure to 
the developers of binary decompilers to find bugs in translating the semantics 
of \ISA instruction to lifted IR. \todo{This line needs to change as program 
synthesis dos not wound right}The technique is based on \tv of the lifting of 
individual \ISA instructions to high-level IR  and uses those validated 
translations  to assist validation of \ISA programs without capitalizing on a 
heavy-weight equivalence checker in the pipeline.
