\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

In conclusion, we demonstrated that validation of lifters w/o instrumentation 
or heavy-weight equivalence checking is feasible.  The design is based  on a 
simple insight: Formal translation validation of 
single machine 
instructions is not only practical, but also can be used as a building 
block for scalable full-program translation validation. Our experimental 
evaluation shows that single instruction validation
is valuable in finding real bugs in a mature lifter. With \siv as build-block, 
we propose a scalable 
approach for full-program translation validation; One that does not require 
heavyweight symbolic execution or theorem 
provers and  based on normalization 
and isomorphic graph matching.
