\section{Program-Level Validation}\label{sec:plv}
The goal of \plv is to validate the translation of the input \ISA program
\s{P} to the Mcsema-lifted \LLVM program \s{T}.  Towards that goal, the first step
is to construct an alternative program \s{T$^\prime$} generated using the \compd
(Section~\ref{sec:compd}), which are then compare for syntactic equivalence 
using (Section~\ref{sec:matcher}).
%\todo{the last part of this sentence is confusing.  do you mean syntactic 
%checking?}
