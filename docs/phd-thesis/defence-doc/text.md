1. How the testing infrastructure works: 

### [NOTES]
- In the previous matching algorithm (based on graph matching of X86 and lifted
    LLVM IR data flow graphs), decompiler agnostic matching was the sole novelty whereas now the novelty
lies in using "Single Instruction Validation" to assist program level
Validation and the compositional Decompiler.
- Single instruction validation and Program level V can be implemented
isolation

- Report time of compd/tuner/matcher ; compare w/wo tuner 

- remove 32 from introduction reference
