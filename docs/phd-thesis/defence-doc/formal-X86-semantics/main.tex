\chapter{Formal Semantics of \ISA User-Level ISA}\label{sec:results}

The equivalence checker being parametric on the semantics of source (\ISA) and
target (LLVM) languages of decompilation, one of the important steps towards
the goal is to define these semantics. In this chapter, we will present our
published contribution~\cite{DasguptaAdve:PLDI19} of the most complete and
thoroughly tested formal semantics of \ISA to date.  Our semantics faithfully
formalizes all the non-deprecated, sequential user-level instructions of the
\ISA Haswell instruction set architecture.  This totals \currentIS{}
instruction variants, corresponding to \currentIntel{} mnemonics. %
%~\cite{IntelManual} (Section~\ref{sec:IC}).  
The semantics is fully executable and has been tested against more than 7,000
instruction-level test cases and the GCC torture test suite. % using the
co-simulation method, This extensive testing paid off, revealing bugs in both
the \ISA reference manual and other existing semantics.  \AEC{We also
  illustrate potential applications of our semantics in different formal
    analyses,
%such as symbolic execution, deductive verification, and translation
  %validation,
and discuss how it can be useful for processor verification.}
