Pursuing a doctorate has been the biggest challenge I have ever pursued
in my life.

We thank the \K team, for their technical support throughout the project, and
the Strata developers, for promptly confirming our reported bugs and answering
all our questions in great detail.  We thank our shepherd, June Andronick, for
her diligence and helpful guidance in responding to the reviewers' comments. We
are grateful to Alastair Reid and Matthew Fernandez for their invaluable
feedback.
